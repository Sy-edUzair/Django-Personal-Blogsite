        <h2>What I do?</h2>
        <p>
            I love programming, I love to help others and I enjoy exploring new tech in general. 
            My other interests include books, gym, nature and just trying out new things!
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to keep growing as a developer and If I could help you do the same, I'd be very happy!
